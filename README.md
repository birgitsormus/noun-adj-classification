# Clustering of Nouns Using the Adjectives that Describe Them

Clustering of nouns based on adjectives using three different models: Spectral Clustering on Jaccard similarities, Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Work done for my bachelor's thesis.

Data extracted from "Eesti keele koondkorpus". Code regarding data extraction and preprocessing can be found in files extract_pairs.ipynb and data_exploration.ipynb.
Code used for training and analysing the three models mentioned above can be found in jaccard.ipynb, nmf.ipynb and lda.ipynb respectively.
